### Navigations

This app requires all 4 types of navigations for effectiveness and content quality. 
These are : 

- **Switch Navigation**: Main navigation form one screen to another 
- **Stack Navigation** : `StackNavigator` includes or holds screens in stack format [which means when a new screen is viewed, it is positioned on top of the existing one]
- **Drawer Navigation** : `DrawerNavigation` is the preferred option for Android and is a type of navigation hint that offers users options and points to different screens using side bar.
- **Tab Navigation** : The `TabNavigator` permits a user to use different screens by simply using the tab that one can use either at the top or bottom of the screen.
